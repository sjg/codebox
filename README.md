CodeBox
=======
A little password protected box that teaches school kids the importance of cryptography.  Add a sprinkle of web sockets with a pinch of JavaScript and whole lot of lights and you get a project which is a whole lot of fun with some prizes at the end

##Introduction
CodeBox is a game where children follow the worksheet to figure out the password to open the box.  The game begins with the teacher showing the webpage (<http://codebox.stevenjamesgray.com>) where the children can quickly register their teams and start guessing the code on their own laptops or mobile phones.  We project the page on the main screen in the room so that everyone can see the current state of the game and see who is guessing what. We also setup and laptop or an iPad at the front of the room to allow players who don't have a phone to play. All players can see each otherâ€™s guesses in real-time on their own devices as well as on the projected screen.  The game ends when the box is opened 3 times and all the prizes are distributed.

##Installing Dependencies 
* npm install socket.io optimist

##Running the BoxServer
This is the socket server that tunnels the requests from the webpage to the physical box in the front of the room.  To run the server then type the following:

* node boxServer.js --key=keyToOpenBox

The small red dot on the webpage will turn green when the server is connected.  Change domains in index.html to point to your domain/server as need be.  Change the port number if needed - default is 8888.

##Surprises
Many surprises await you in the repository; you just need to find them!
